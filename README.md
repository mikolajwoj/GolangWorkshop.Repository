**Golang Examples**

This repository contains a collection of example Golang programs. The programs are organized by topic, and each topic includes a README file that provides more information about the programs and how to use them.

**Getting Started**

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:[your-username]/golang-examples.git
